### Under Construction

You will notice the ```src```, ```include```, and ```cmake``` folders as empty. I am using the ```tests``` directory to build out
the system layer by layer. Each sub-directory is a logically different component and all these directories are built separately. Each directory is just an unorganizing collection of source and header files. The majority of files are just copied (and tweaked) between each stage. It is certainly not clean, but it has been getting the job done so far. 

When things are ready, all of the source and headers files will be copied to approrpirate locations and a proper build structure will be put in place.

The most-up-to-date and current progress is being made within ```tests/test_inventory```
